# Sample PingOne for Customers transaction approval with Spring Boot

Sample Java Spring Boot transaction approval application. This application adds transaction approval to the Sample OIDC Spring Boot application.  Details about the application, the deployment and use can be found in this (TBD) blog post.

The application is not intended for use in production and it is only to demonstrate some P14C capabilities in a demo context:

- it did not go through any code review or penetration testing
- only successful flows are assumed 
- error handling has not been implemented
- limited functional testing has been carried out
